Determining the location of the ModelSim executable...

Using: /media/hari-the-geth/HARI_VIVADO/modelsim_ase_hp/modelsim_ase/bin

To specify a ModelSim executable directory, select: Tools -> Options -> EDA Tool Options
Note: if both ModelSim-Altera and ModelSim executables are available, ModelSim-Altera will be used.
